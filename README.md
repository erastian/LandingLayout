# HTML SCSS Landing layout training project
<hr>

So, this is a training project. <br>
The main idea of the project - create responsive layout <br>
of some abstract landing page. Used for `html` and `sass` <br>
preprocessor, followed by compilation via `gulp` scripts and build

<br>

Main goal - practice with `Figma mockup` and `scss` preprocessor. <br><br><br>

#### For installation
```shell
$ npm i
```

#### For build
```shell
$ npm run build
```

#### For run
```shell
$ npm run dev
```

###### Funny moments
